What's new in PSMSlugForever
=============================
What is PSMSlugForever?

It is called Project Shadow Metal Slug Forever, this project was part of the HBMAME emulator in the year 2018 – 2020.

Afterwards, it has been decided to make the project independent in 2021, providing all kinds of support, repairing all bugs 
and glitches, correcting incompatibility with the NeoGeo system, etc.

Version 0.224 [HBMAME] is being used as the base system.

I am only giving support for the Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems, 
for the 86/64 bit cpu of the compatible microprocessors.

Please Note That The Use Of This Emulator Is Prohibited For Any Commercial Use Or Using The Project For A Fundraising Fundraiser.

2023-02-01...Update 02-18

- Fixed the text of the Metal Slug 5 Encrypted Set and metal slug bios.
- Fixed the Hybrid bullets version, now it skips level 2 that causes a crash.
- This Roms Hack "Metal Slug 3 (Random Enemies Resetting Version)" is very problematic with the HBMAME/PSMAMEPLUS emulator, it prevents you from being able to play most of the random 
  scenarios that are included in this version, this mentioned problem does not occur with the FB Alpha/FBNEO emulator.
  How is this?
  It is established through three random scenarios, interspersing the scenarios of each level that will be played.
  The problem this causes is that the rom starts with two random scenarios instead of three,
  apart from when the game starts, 99% will start one of the random scenarios, 1% the second of the random scenarios and 0% for the 
  third random scenarios.
  For this the roms have been corrected, now either separating by each random scenario becomes an individual roms:
  Random enemies that reset version #1
  Random enemies that reset version #2
  Random enemies that reset version #3
- The commands have been configured, now you will have a much easier access to access it:
  * The command to enable save games, with the "7" key.
  * The command to enable loading games, with the "8" key.
  * The command to reset games, with the "9" key.
  * The command to enter the NeoGeo bios, with the "0" key.
  * The command to pause the game, with the "P" key.
  * The command to display the time in real time in the game, with the "O" key.
  * The command to speed up the "FPS" Frames per second to the game, with the "I" key.
  * The command to be able to play on the screen in windowed mode, with the "U" key.
  * The command to apply a graphic filter to it, with the "Ñ" key.
  * The command to accelerate the game, with the "Back Space" key.
  * The command to apply God mode, with the "L" key.
  * The command to apply God mode II, with the "M" key.
  * The command to apply God mode III, with the "N" key.
  * The command to apply God mode IV, with the "B" key.
  * The command to apply God mode V, with the "V" key.
  * The command to apply God mode VI, with the "C" key.
  * The command to enable the debug menu, with the "K" key [This works only in Metal Slug 2/X up to Metal Slug 5]
   * Once enabled you have to hold down the "3" button in turn plus the "Z" button, it will be enabled. The Debug menu is written in a mixture of Japanese and English text
    [Remember that the "Z" button represents the "D" Button in the NeoGeo system]
   * Once achieved, it opens up endless possibilities during the games. With it we can access many hidden options in the
     game that would otherwise go unnoticed.
   * The command to end the current mission instantly, with the "J" key.
  * The command to enable Console Mode, with the "Space Bar" key.
   * For it to work correctly you have to apply the "9" command to reset the game, if it worked it wouldn't work
     a will inform on the screen that the "Hardware Test Failed The Bios" we will press the "S" key [Remember that the "S" button represents the "B" button in the NeoGeo system]
     Now it will launch the Console Mode.
  * The command to enable the ability to destroy all enemies on the screen, with the "." key.
    Once enabled you have to press the "Z" key [Remember that the "Z" button represents the "D" button in the NeoGeo system]
    We will press the "Z" key every time we want to destroy all the enemies on the screen.

  * There is some unique command that is only used in some Metal Slug:
  * The command to skip missions only Works in Metal Slug 2:
   * With the "R" key, jump to mission 2.
   * With the "T" key, jump to mission 3.
   * With the "Y" key, jump to mission 4.
   * With the "G" key, jump to mission 5.
   * With the "H" key, jump to mission 6.
  * The command to enable Hit Anywhere, with the "," key. [Works on Metal Slug 2/3]
  * The command to enable Pin Point Attack, with the "Alt" key. [Works on Metal Slug X]
  * The command to enable Survival Attack, with the "AltGr" key. [Works on Metal Slug X]
   * It is recommended to use it with some God Mode command, since since it does not have infinite life, there is a possibility that it ends
     the game crashing will have to restart once you lose all life.

- With this we finish the collection of Metal Slug decrypted/bootleg.
  * Metal Slug 6 (Metal Slug 3 bootleg, decrypted C)
- Causes the game to crash "mslug3ly01-07", which is generated by repeatedly pressing the "D" button
  at the time of the players death [Although the character is being ingested
  by the carnivorous plant, one continues to press the "D" button endlessly and the player's special ability
  continue doing] when the carnivorous plant is fully ingested, you will lose instantly you will have to enter
  more credits continue playing, once past this will happen when selecting a character when you scroll left or 
  right the game quickly causes a crash you are forced to restart everything.
* The only way to play without issue is to enable the Invincibility cheat.
